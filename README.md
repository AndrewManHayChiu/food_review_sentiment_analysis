# Rubix Assessment - Food Review Sentiment Analysis

## Introduction

## Methodology

In Natural Language processing, as in many machine learning applications, 
simple approaches can go a long way.

The approach adopted includes a bag of words representation of the text,
where each word becomes a column, and an indicator of how many times the word
exists in each review.

Additional features are engineered to add to the bag of words, including:

* Sentiments
* Topics
* Word length

### Tagging reviews

### Dev-Test

To replicate a production environment, Git is used to develop the application.


### Assumptions

Each review should be about something; a subject.

Most of the time, this is obvious, but if it's not, 
then the assumption is that it's about the RESTAURANT.

### Relevance Measure
